# images_generated_using_comfyui
This project focuses on image generation using Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI, two cutting-edge technologies that enable the creation of high-quality, realistic images from textual or visual inputs. Stable Diffusion is a powerful AI model that generates images through an iterative denoising process, while ComfyUI provides a user-friendly interface to simplify and customize the image generation workflow. Together, these tools offer a versatile solution for creative and practical applications, making advanced image generation accessible to artists, designers, and developers.
